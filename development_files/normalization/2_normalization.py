# Will do the same thing for directions keywords

#Because get_dummies doesn't work on lists, explode seperates the values in each list of ingredients. This ceates a row per ingredient, 
# so there are multiple rows for each recipe. 
# using get_dummies turns each ingredient into a column, and puts 1 where it exists and 0 where it doesn't exist. But since there are multiple
# rows per recipe, this creates a multi-level index, where every ingredient adds a new row to each recipe. 
# sum merges the rows that should be one row, so each recipe returns to one row, with all the ingredients it has.
# does the same thing for directions_keywords
